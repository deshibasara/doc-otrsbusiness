                Please note that SMS character counter might not be reflecting the final
message size. This is especially true if message text contains OTRS tags or
links and URL shorting feature is turned on. Since text replacement will
occur during sending of the message, there is no way to guarantee final
size, and counter should be taken only for informative purposes.

        <para>
            Recipients of an SMS article are listed inside the Recipients field. They
can be shown in two formats: just phone numbers or phone numbers with name
of corresponding customer users. In addition to this field, Transaction
numbers will contain a reference message ID mapped to the recipients phone
number. These numbers can be used for debugging purposes, since they can be
connected to specific messages handled by the cloud service.
