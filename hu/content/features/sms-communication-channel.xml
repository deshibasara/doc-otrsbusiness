shortening links in SMS texts. If enabled, any link submitted as part of SMS

will be shortened only if their length is larger than resulting shortened

            By adding specific phone numbers to the <emphasis>Phone black

text via cloud service (whether it's a notification or an article). Make
sure to input phone numbers in international format, complete with plus sign
(+) and country code, without any spaces.

            This screen behaves similar to new email and phone screens, with some
notable exceptions. Instead of email addresses,
<emphasis>Recipients</emphasis> field accepts only phone numbers in

configuration screen.

                Please note that SMS character counter might not be reflecting the final
message size. This is especially true if message text contains OTRS tags or
links and URL shorting feature is turned on. Since text replacement will
occur during sending of the message, there is no way to guarantee final
size, and counter should be taken only for informative purposes.

            SMS articles can be displayed as they were sent out right in the ticket zoom

by the SMS cloud service for sending (with all tags replaced and links
shortened).
        </para>
        <para>
            Recipients of an SMS article are listed inside the
<emphasis>Recipients</emphasis> field. They can be shown in two formats:
just phone numbers or phone numbers with name of corresponding customer
users. In addition to this field, <emphasis>Transaction Numbers</emphasis>
will contain a reference message ID mapped to the recipients phone
number. These numbers can be used for debugging purposes, since they can be
connected to specific messages handled by the cloud service.
