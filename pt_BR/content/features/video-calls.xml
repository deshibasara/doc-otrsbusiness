    <title>Video and Audio Calls</title>

        <title>Descrição</title>
        <para>
            The video and audio calls feature of the <emphasis role="bold">OTRS Business
Solution</emphasis>™ provides real-time calls between two users right from
the comfort of the OTRS frontend. The calls will be provided over a direct
peer-to-peer connection established between two users, where possible. This
feature depends heavily on the chat, which must be active for video and
audio calls to be possible.
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>
                Video and audio calls are based on a quite young technology called
WebRTC. The implementation of WebRTC APIs in modern browsers is an ongoing
effort. Currently, OTRS video and audio calls are supported only in the
latest versions of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome (for Chrome a <link
linkend="chrome-ssl-required">HTTPS Enabled Web Server</link> is required).

                Video and audio calls are tied to existing chats. As an agent, you will be
able to initiate calls inside and outside of chats. Customer users will be
able to initiate calls only from an active chat.

            <para>
                If a chat does not yet exist, it will be created when the call is
initiated. In these "ad-hoc" chats, the chat parties are joined
automatically. When a call is terminated, these chats will remain active
until they are closed manually.

                The only difference between video and audio calls is that audio calls will
mute your video stream initially (which you will be able to turn on later in
the call). The video stream will be muted for both parties by default, but
they will be able to control it.
            </para>
            <para>
                If the other party has muted their video stream, instead of the video you
will see a large microphone icon in the center, along with their name. The
icon will reflect the state of their audio stream, and if they mute it too,
it will be crossed.

                If you have made yourself available for chats (either internal or external),
video and audio call invitations are received automatically by one of the
active tabs in the same user session. When you receive an invitation, a
modal dialog will be displayed on your screen, allowing you to accept or
decline the invitation.

        <para>
            In the best case scenario, video and audio calls will be streamed over a
direct peer-to-peer connection between users' browsers. The requirement is
that the user's network allows connection over a high port that WebRTC uses,
and can advertise this to the other party. To this end, there are several
mechanisms in place to aid in connecting.

                    STUN is a standardized set of methods and a network protocol to allow an end

the other party to allow the connection to be established.

                <para>
                    TURN is a protocol that assists in traversal of network address translators
or firewalls for multimedia applications. OTRS also provides TURN cloud
service which can help clients on networks masqueraded by symmetric NAT
devices and it supports the connection of a user behind a NAT.
                </para>
                <para>
                    In case of a connection established via TURN server, media streams will be
routed through the server (like a proxy). In this situation, all packets are
securely transmitted to the other side. The access to the TURN server is
encrypted and secured by often changed credentials, which are provided
automatically.

                <para>
                    In case all UDP traffic is blocked between two users, the TURN server over
TCP is a last resort for a successful connection. While TCP is not an ideal
protocol for transmitting media packets, it's a last resort in an effort to
connect two users and share their streams.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Same as with TURN over UDP, media streams will be routed through the server
and sent to the other side. The infrastructure for all STUN and TURN
services is highly scalable based on demand and can even be provided for
different geographic locations, in order to provide the best possible
throughput.
