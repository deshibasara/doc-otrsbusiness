    <title>SMS Notifications and Notification Web View</title>

    <section>
        <title>Description</title>
        <para>
            The <emphasis role="bold">OTRS Business Solution</emphasis>â„¢ comes with two new notification features: SMS
            notifications and the notification web view. Both of them are technically notification methods besides the
            existing email method and can be activated for each notification (e.g. <emphasis>Ticket new note notification</emphasis> or
            <emphasis>Ticket create notification</emphasis>) on the <emphasis>Notification Event</emphasis> screen in the Admin interface.
        </para>

        <title>Setting up SMS Notifications</title>
        <note>
            <para>
                Before taking advantage of SMS notification transport method, you must first
                <link linkend="sms-cloud-service-activate">activate the SMS cloud service</link>.
            </para>
        </note>
        <para>
            In order to use SMS as a way of notification for admins and customers, you have to buy an SMS unit package.
            Please get in touch with sales@otrs.com on this matter. Once you've bought a package, you will be able to
            look up your current contingent of remaining SMS units on the admin screen for the SMS cloud service
            (<literal>AdminCloudServiceSMS</literal>).
        </para>
        <para>
            To make SMS available for notifications, you have to enable it for the notifications of your choice in
            <emphasis>Notification Event</emphasis> screen in the Admin interface. Besides the existing <emphasis>Email</emphasis> notification method, you can enable SMS notifications
            by enabling the checkbox as to be seen in the screenshot below.
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>
                Please be careful using the <emphasis>Send by default</emphasis> checkbox on SMS notifications. Enabling this checkbox will
                cause this notification to be sent by SMS to all agents with a phone number stored in the configured
                field. This could cause a high usage of your available SMS units!
            </para>
        </note>
        <para>
            On this screen, you can also add more generic phone numbers (e.g. for archiving purposes) which will receive
            all of the relevant notifications (besides the addressed agents). Please note that all of these recipients
            will be treated as customers (regarding article creation).

            If you configured a notification to be visible in the agent preferences, agents will now be able to
            enable/disable SMS notifications manually on their own for this notification.

            SMS notification text will be constructed on fly by combining both <emphasis>Subject</emphasis> and <emphasis>Text</emphasis> fields of the
            corresponding language. You can of course use supported OTRS tags in these fields, and additionally URLs can
            be shortened by activating URL shortening option in cloud service configuration.

            Once you've enabled the notification web view for a certain notification, agents will see a new icon on top
            of their screen in OTRS (within the toolbar) each time a new notification arrives.
