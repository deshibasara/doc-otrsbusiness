    <title>SMS Notifications and Notification Web View</title>

    <section>
        <title>Description</title>
        <para>
            The <emphasis role="bold">OTRS Business Solution</emphasis>â„¢ comes with two new notification features: SMS notifications and the notification web view. Both of them are technically notification methods besides the existing email method and can be activated for each notification (e.g. "Ticket new note notification" or "Ticket create notification") on the AdminNotificationEvent screen.
        </para>

        <title>Setting up SMS Notifications</title>
        <para>
            In order to use SMS as a way of notification for admins and customers, you have to buy a SMS unit package. Please get in touch with sales@otrs.com on this matter. Once you've bought a package, you will be able to look up your current contingent of remaining SMS units on the admin screen for the SMS cloud service (AdminCloudServiceSMS).

            </figure>
        </para>
        <para>
            On this screen, you can also set up some more parameters of the SMS feature, e.g. the sender string which should be used for the SMS text messages or the agent/customer preference field which should be used to take the mobile phone number from.
        </para>
        <para>
            To make SMS available for notifications, you have to enable it for the notifications of your choice in AdminNotificationEvent. Besides the existing "Email" notification method, you can enable SMS notifications by enabling the checkbox as to be seen in the screenshot below.
        </para>
        <note>
            <para>
                Please be careful using the "Send by default" checkbox on SMS notifications. Enabling this checkbox will cause this notification to be sent by SMS to all agents with a phone number stored in the configured field. This could cause a high usage of your available SMS units!
            </para>
        </note>
        <para>
            On this screen, you can also add more generic phone numbers (e.g. for archiving purposes) which will receive all of the relevant notifications (besides the addressed agents).

        <para>
            If you configured a notification to be visible in the agent preferences, agents will now be able to enable/disable SMS notifications manually on their own for this notification.

            Once you've enabled the notification web view for a certain notification, agents will see a new icon on top of their screen in OTRS (within the toolbar) each time a new notification arrives.
