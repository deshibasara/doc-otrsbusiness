        <title>Description</title>
        <para>
            The chat feature of <emphasis role="bold">OTRS Business Solution</emphasis>™ allows for chats between agents and customers using the OTRS frontend. Once enabled, customers (or public users) can start chats with agents and vice versa. Finished chats can be archived and attached to tickets, or can be downloaded as PDF by agents, customers and public users.
        </para>
        <para>
            Each chat is assigned to a chat channel. Chat channels are like chat rooms. Each chat channel is assigned to a certain group which controls the permissions for this channel. If no chat channel is selected when a chat is created, this chat will be created in a default channel (which is automatically created if it doesn't exist).

You'll need to assign an existing agent group to each channel you'll create. You can use the screens "Agents &lt;-&gt; Groups" or "Agents &lt;-&gt; Roles" to assign permissions.

It's a three-way switch with these states: unavailable for chats (empty circle), available for internal (agent-to-agent) chats (empty circle with tick sign), available for internal and external (customer-to-agent, public-to-agent) chats (filled circle with tick sign). Just click the toggle in order to change your availability.

                The chat manager is the central point of the chat feature. As an agent, here you can manage your chats and see and accept open requests. The chat manager provides a list of chat requests from customers, public users and other agents, as well as an overview over all active chats. Open the chat manager by using "Chat" in the main navigation of OTRS.

                        To start a chat with another agent, you can use the user online widget from the dashboard. Agents who are able to use the chat, will have a chat icon next to their name which you can click on. Once clicked, a chat form will open which you can use to enter your first chat message to this agent. After the chat request has been sent to the other agent, you can watch the chat in the chat manager.

If you would like to integrate the public chat module into your website, you can use the IsIframe parameter. The OTRS header and footer will then be removed from the view (public.pl?Action=PublicChat;IsIframe=1).

                If there is a new chat request in one of the channels you (as an agent) have permissions for, you'll receive a browser notification which allows you to go directly to the chat manager. After you've opened the chat manager, you can see a list of open requests of all types (see figure below).

            <para>
                Use the "open chat" button from the list to see the details of the request. Clicking the button will open an overlay which provides several actions on this request. Given that you've got sufficient permissions, you can accept the request or change the channel for this request. Changing the channel will follow the same rules as creating new request: you can only move the request to a channel which has active agents in it.
            </para>
            <para>
                Changing the chat channel without accepting the request could be used to dispatch chats to the right department for example.

                The chat widget is the main component you'll use when chatting with other people. It provides a history of all messages in the chat as well as list of possible actions (depending on your permission level).

            <para>
                To send messages, you can use the text field in the chat widget in your list of active chats. Once you are done with typing your message, submit it by either clicking the send icon next to the text field, or using tab and enter (consecutively). When the message has been sent, the cursor will jump back to the text field to allow for easily continuing to type.

                        From the chat widget head top right hand side, you can close the chat by clicking the "x" icon. Clicking the circle icon right next to the close icon, allows you to set up a personal monitoring for this chat, which is again a three-way switch (no monitoring = empty circle, only monitor customer activity = empty circle with tick icon, monitor all actions = filled circle with tick icon). When monitoring a chat, browser notifications will show up each time there is a new action in this chat.

If you join the chat as observer, you will only be able to read what others are contributing to the chat and you will be invisible to customers or public users. Agents will still receive a message that you joined the chat as observer.

                        the configured amount of time, there are probably no agents available for chatting and you have
                        configured the chat shouldn't show up in this case.

                            agent is available" option in the Configuration tab, and refresh the code.
