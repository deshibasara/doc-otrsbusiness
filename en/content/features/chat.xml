                The chat manager is the central point of the chat feature. As an agent, here you can manage your chats, see and accept open requests and change your chat availability status. The chat manager provides a list of chat requests from customers, public users and other agents, as well as an overview over all active chats. Open the chat manager by using "Chat" in the main navigation of OTRS.
            </para>
            <para>
                You can set your general availability for the chat by using the checkbox in the left sidebar of the chat manager. Once disabled, you'll no longer get notified for incoming chat requests.

Once you are done with typing your message, submit it by either clicking the send icon next to the text field, or using tab and enter (consecutively).

                As an agent, there are multiple ways to start a chat. First of all, you can use the user online widget on the dashboard to chat with agents or customers who are currently logged in to OTRS. Just click the little chat icon behind the name of the agent or customer. A small overlay will appear and allow for entering the first chat message you would like to send to the other user. Afterwards, the new chat is being added to the chat manager.
            </para>
            <para>
                You can also use ticket zoom to start a chat with a certain customer. In the sidebar, you'll find a chat link in the customer information widget.
            </para>
            <para>
                If new chat requests arrive and you're logged in to OTRS, you'll get notified by a chat icon in the toolbar on top of the screen. The icon also holds information about how many open chat requests are available at the moment. Just click the icon to open the chat manager. You'll also receive a browser notification (popup) in case of new chat requests.
            </para>
            <para>
                All agents with the needed permissions will be able to deal with open chat requests. A request can only be accepted by one agent at the same time, which means that the request will disappear from the other agents lists once if has been accepted by an agent. Once accepted, the newly created chat will be appended to the list of active chats for the agent who has accepted it. Other users in the chat will see a notification about the user who just entered the chat.

                As an agent, you have several possiblities to end a chat. First of all, you can just discard a chat by using the "x" icon on the right top side of the chat widget in the chat manager. The chat then just will be closed without archiving it. Other users in the chat will just see a message telling them the chat was ended.
            </para>
            <para>
                You can also append the chat to an existing ticket. Click the "+" icon on the right top of the chat widget in the chat manager. A new window will open which allows for selecting a ticket which the chat should be appended to.
            </para>
            <para>
                If you don't have any appropriate ticket to append the chat to, you can also create a new one by using the phone icon on the top right side of the chat widget in the chat manager.
